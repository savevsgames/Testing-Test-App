## Description

The **Testing Test App** is a MERN stack application designed to provide users with a tech quiz comprising ten random questions. Upon completion, users can view their final score and have the option to start a new quiz. This project emphasizes the integration of Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing, ensuring robust and reliable application performance.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/savevsgames/Testing-Test-App.git

```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd Testing-Test-App
```

### 3. Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm run install
```

This command installs dependencies for both the server and the client.

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables:

- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
- Configure the necessary environment variables within the `.env` file based on your application requirements.

---

## Usage Instructions

### Start the Application:

```bash
npm start
```

This command builds the client and starts the server.

### Access the Application:

- Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to interact with the quiz.

## Test Instructions

### Open Cypress Test Runner:

To open the Cypress test runner for interactive testing, run:

```bash
npm run cypress
```

### Run All Tests:

To execute all Cypress tests in headless mode, run:

```bash
npm run testrun
```

This command will run the tests and output the results in the terminal.

---

### Notes:

- For local development with live reload, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This starts the server in development mode and serves the client application for live updates.

- Ensure that the required services (e.g., database, APIs) are running if the app has external dependencies.
